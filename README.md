# Finding the Minimum Vertex Cover
(Submitted towards the completion of CS 3013: Artificial Intelligence, in collaboration with Chaitanya Bhojwani and Prerna Jotwani)

In graph theory, a vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge of the graph. Finding a minimum vertex cover is a classic optimization problem in computer science and is a typical example of an NP-hard optimization problem.

The vertex cover *V'* of an undirected graph *G=(V,E)* is a subset of *V* such that *uv in E -> u in V'* v *v in V'*

The mimimum vertex cover is the smallest vertex cover possible.

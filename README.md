# Finding the Minimum Vertex Cover
(Submitted towards the completion of CS 3013: Artificial Intelligence, in collaboration with Chaitanya Bhojwani and Prerna Jotwani)

In graph theory, a vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge of the graph. Finding a minimum vertex cover is a classic optimization problem in computer science and is a typical example of an NP-hard optimization problem.

The vertex cover {\displaystyle V'}V' of an undirected graph {\displaystyle G=(V,E)}G=(V,E) is a subset of {\displaystyle V}V such that {\displaystyle uv\in E\Rightarrow u\in V'\lor v\in V'}{\displaystyle uv\in E\Rightarrow u\in V'\lor v\in V'}

The mimimum vertex cover is the smallest vertex cover possible.
